This project was developed by Victor Ren, Scott Ho, Jessica Yang, Eric Wang and Chris Warcholyk. The \mbox{\hyperlink{classfacAIlizer}{fac\+A\+Ilizer}} is designed to run on any windows, linux, or mac\+O\+Sx based machine.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{In order to develop the program, Microsoft Visual Studio Code was used as the I\+D\+E of choice.}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
Please ensure that your machine is paired with a functional U\+VC supported camera in order to avoid hardware related issues, as this program is functionally dependant on camera use. Please ensure that all dependencies are previously installed, including frugally-\/deep as fdeep, Eigen3 as eigen, Functional\+Plus as fplus, nlohmann\+\_\+json as json, boost and opencv. Trained fdeep.\+Models have already been included for use with the program.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Upon all dependencies having been installed, please build the program with the following commands from $\sim$/fac\+A\+Ilizer\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
\begin{DoxyVerb}#Build
cd build && cmake ..
make
./facAIlizer
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Upon running the program, a display window will open, and the camera will be taken as input and displayed within the window.}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
The \mbox{\hyperlink{classfacAIlizer}{fac\+A\+Ilizer}} program will detect and draw a rectangle around the faces of users present within the camera\textquotesingle{}s vision, at which point it will begin determining the Gender and Emotion of each face detected in real time, displaying the info on the top of each rectangle --so that the relevant info is attatched to to the respective user-- and displaying the confidence levels as a bar graph for the first user.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Reasons for dependency choices\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
fdeep\+: for use with loading the models provided and the tensors. eigen\+: for use with fdeep as a dependency. fplus\+: for use with fdeep as a dependency json\+: for use with fdeep and loading the models provided. ~\newline
 Boost\+: for use with trimming tensor strings, and as an opencv dependency. Opencv\+: for use with working with the camera and display window.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{For help with dependencies\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
